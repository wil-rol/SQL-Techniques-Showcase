# SQL-Techniques-Showcase
A demonstration of SQL proficiency using made-up data, showcasing various querying techniques, data manipulation, and database design concepts.

# Dataset
The data in Table 1 was provided by the class professor and do not represent any real world dataset. 

# Methodology
This project is a comprehensive demonstration of SQL proficiency using a made-up dataset, designed to showcase essential and advanced database techniques. It includes data creation, normalization, and schema design to reflect real-world database structures. Various querying techniques, such as aggregations, joins, subqueries, common table expressions (CTEs), and window functions, are utilized to extract meaningful insights. The project also covers data manipulation tasks like inserting, updating, and deleting records, as well as optimizing queries for performance. Additionally, database constraints, indexing strategies, and stored procedures are implemented to highlight best practices in SQL development.
